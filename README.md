#  💼 Diversity-Inclusion-HR-Dashboard
## 🧩 Project Overview
**Human Resources** at a leading telecom company has been working to improve gender diversity, with a particular focus on executive-level representation. Despite ongoing efforts, gender balance in leadership has remained stagnant. This project was developed as part of the **PwC Virtual Case Experience on Forage**, simulating a real-world HR analytics engagement. It explores key HR metrics—**hiring**, **promotion**, **performanc**e, and **turnover**—to identify barriers to gender equity at the executive level. The final deliverable includes an interactive Power BI dashboard, advanced DAX-based KPIs, and data-driven recommendations to support the company’s diversity and inclusion goals.  
## 📌 2. Objectives of the Analysis
✅ Assess gender diversity across different job levels.  
✅ Analyze promotions and career growth opportunities by gender.    
✅ Compare performance ratings of men vs. women.   
✅ Assess whether performance influences promotion decisions  
✅ Evaluate turnover trends and understand retention challenges.   
✅ Identify gaps in executive-level gender representation.   
✅ Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance inclusion efforts.   

## 📌 1. Key Insights & Findings  
### 🔹 1. Workforce Composition & Hiring Trends   
✅ **Total Employees**: 500    
✅ **Gender Breakdown**: 59% Men (295), 41% Women (205)    
✅ **New Hires**: 66 employees hired → 52% women, 48% men

🔹 **Insight**:

* The hiring process is relatively balanced (52% women vs. 48% men), which suggests gender-neutral recruitment efforts.

* However, hiring alone is not improving gender diversity at leadership levels, indicating a promotion gap rather than a recruitment gap.

### 🔹 2. Promotion Trends & Gender Disparity    
✅ **Promotion Rate FY20**: 7% (36 employees promoted, 22% were women while 78% were men)    
✅ **Promotion Rate FY21**: 10.2% (51 employees promoted, 35% were women while 65% were men)   
✅ **Women’s Promotion Rate (FY21)**: 8.78%   
✅ **Men’s Promotion Rate (FY21)**: 11.19%    

![Diversity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcb50c97-db10-4114-8dc8-820018186d9f)


🔹 **Insight**:
* Women’s promotion rate (8.78%) is lower than men’s (11.19%), meaning men are advancing faster.

* Women make up 41% of the workforce but received only 35% of promotions, indicating gender disparity in career progression.

* Sales & Marketing and Operations have the highest number of promotions, suggesting career advancement opportunities vary by department.

### 🔹 3. Executive Leadership Gender Gap

| Fiscal Year | Total Executives | Women Executives | Men Executives | % Women | % Men | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|-------|-------|
| FY19        | 10               | 2                | 8              | 20%     | 80%   | -     |
| FY20        | 16               | 2                | 14             | 13.5%   | 87.5% | 2 men promoted, 4 men hired externally |
| FY21        | 19               | 3                | 16             | 16%     | 84%   | 3 men and 1 woman promoted |

🔹 **Insight**:   
* Women are significantly underrepresented at the executive level, and progress over the years has been minimal. Most new executive roles have been filled by men, either through 
   promotion or external hiring, highlighting a critical bottleneck in leadership diversity.

⚠️ The slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive level suggests potential barriers for women in leadership advancement.

### 🔹 4. Turnover Rate & Retention Issues  
✅ **Total Leavers**: 47 employees   
✅ **Overall Turnover Rate**: 9.40%   
✅ **Women’s Turnover Rate**: 10.24%   
✅ **Men’s Turnover Rate**: 8.81%   

![Inclusion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b812582-5e23-4fdb-b08b-9880e90aa62e)


🔹 **Insight**:

* Women have a higher turnover rate than men (10.24% vs. 8.81%), indicating possible dissatisfaction or career stagnation.

* Higher female turnover could be linked to fewer promotion opportunities or a lack of leadership pathways.  
* Losing high-potential women contributes to the ongoing gender imbalance, especially at the executive level.

⚠️ If women leave at a higher rate, it further reduces the talent pool for leadership roles, reinforcing gender imbalance at the executive level.

### 🔹 5. Performance Ratings & Promotion Trends
✅ **Average Performance Rating (FY19)**: 2.57   
✅ **Average Performance Rating (FY20)**: 2.41 (a decline from FY19)   
✅ **Women’s Performance Rating (FY19 → FY20)**: 2.56 → 2.42   
✅ **Men’s Performance Rating (FY19 → FY20)**: 2.58 → 2.41   
✅ Leavers have higher performance ratings than non-leavers   
✅ Promoted employees have lower performance ratings than non-promoted employees

🔹 **Insight**:

* Performance ratings have declined across the board, suggesting either a shift in evaluation criteria or reduced employee engagement.

* Women’s performance ratings were slightly higher than men’s in FY20, yet their promotion rate was lower.

* The fact that leavers have higher ratings than those who stayed suggests that high-performing employees may feel undervalued and are seeking better opportunities elsewhere.

* Promoted employees having lower ratings than non-promoted employees suggests that promotions may not be strictly performance-based.

⚠️  Promotion decisions may be influenced by factors other than performance, such as tenure or manager discretion, which could disadvantage high-performing employees, particularly women.

## 🧠Root Causes of Slow Gender Progress at Executive Level
   * **Bias in Promotion Criteria**: Despite strong performance and tenure, women are promoted less often than men.

   * **Leaky Pipeline**: Higher female turnover limits the pool for executive promotion.

   * **Executive Hiring Patterns**: Men are more frequently hired directly into executive roles than women.

   * **Role Allocation**: Women may be concentrated in departments with fewer paths to executive promotion (e.g., support vs. revenue-generating functions).

   * **Longer Time to Promotion**: Women spend longer in the same job levels than men, indicating potential delays in upward mobility.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1️⃣ Redesign Promotion Criteria
   * Ensure objective, performance-based criteria that prevent bias in promotion decisions.

2️⃣ Targeted Executive Development Programs
   * Create tailored leadership pathways and mentorships for high-potential women.

3️⃣ Retention Strategy for Women
   * Investigate causes for female turnover via exit interviews or surveys.

4️⃣ Department-Level D&I Reviews
   * Focus on departments with historically low promotion or high attrition rates.

5️⃣Data-Driven Monitoring
   * Establish KPIs to continuously track gender ratios in recruitment, promotion, and exits.

## 📌 Conclusion
The data reveals meaningful strides in hiring balance but highlights persistent gaps in promotion and retention of women, especially at the executive level. While the organization is recruiting more women, these gains are offset by **higher female turnover** and **slower promotion rates**, undermining long-term diversity goals.

To truly shift the dial, the organization must go beyond hiring – they must retain, develop, and promote women at the same pace as men, especially in decision-making roles. A combination of data-driven policy, leadership commitment, and cultural change is critical to building a more inclusive and representative organization.
